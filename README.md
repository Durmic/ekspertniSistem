Expert system

DoctuS is a shell that represents another way of building an expert system.
It serves as a support for managerial decision-making.
In business, decision rules are determined by connections between symbols (ambiguous untyped characters) there and then.
The place of preparing business decisions is where there is a big picture.
Doctus represents a framework that helps the decision maker in modeling his knowledge in chaotic business situations of preparing strategic decisions.
Today, there is a tendency towards quick business decisions. The project of this seminar work was created with the help of the Doctus expert system shell.
